#summary Compiling guide.

= Prerequisites =
SFML.Net: https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML.Net

CSFML: https://github.com/LaurentGomila/CSFML

SFML.Net contains latest Windows CSFML libraries, so CSFML is only needed for Linux build.

Tao framework: http://www.mono-project.com/Tao. I'll most likely change that to OpenTK later.

You need to recompile SFML.Net with small modifications for input system to work:
in sfml-window\EventArgs.cs change KeyEventArgs constructor to:
{{{
public KeyEventArgs(KeyEvent e, bool down)
{
    Code    = e.Code;
    Alt     = e.Alt != 0;
    Control = e.Control != 0;
    Shift   = e.Shift != 0;
    System  = e.System != 0;
    Down = down;
}
}}}
and add
{{{public bool Down;}}}
to the KeyEventArgs class.

Similarly, change MouseButtonEventArgs constructor

{{{
public MouseButtonEventArgs(MouseButtonEvent e, bool down)
{
    Button = e.Button;
    X      = e.X;
    Y      = e.Y;
    Down = down;
}
}}}
and add Down field to the class:
{{{public bool Down;}}}

In Window.cs change Window::CallEventHandler(Event e)

{{{
case EventType.KeyPressed :
    if (KeyPressed != null)
        KeyPressed(this, new KeyEventArgs(e.Key, true));
    break;

case EventType.KeyReleased :
    if (KeyReleased != null)
        KeyReleased(this, new KeyEventArgs(e.Key, false));
    break;

case EventType.MouseButtonPressed :
    if (MouseButtonPressed != null)
        MouseButtonPressed(this, new MouseButtonEventArgs(e.MouseButton, true));
    break;

case EventType.MouseButtonReleased :
    if (MouseButtonReleased != null)
        MouseButtonReleased(this, new MouseButtonEventArgs(e.MouseButton, false));
    break;
}}}

After recompiling SFML.Net you can build GwenCS.
