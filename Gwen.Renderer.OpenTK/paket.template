summary
    GWEN.Net is a .Net port of GWEN. GWEN is a lightweight GUI library aimed at games.
    It contains rich widget collection and most functionality you'd expect from a GUI framework.
description
    Original code is C++ written by Garry Newman.
    GWEN.Net is NOT a wrapper/binding and does not need the original C++ library.
    It's a complete rewrite in C# for use by .NET applications.
