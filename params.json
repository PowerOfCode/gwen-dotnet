  "body": "GWEN.Net is a .Net port of GWEN. GWEN is a lightweight GUI library aimed at games. It contains rich widget collection and most functionality you'd expect from a GUI framework. See http://code.google.com/p/gwen/ and https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/gwen-discuss for details.\r\n\r\nOriginal code is C++ written by Garry Newman. GWEN.Net is NOT a wrapper/binding and does not need the original C++ library. It's a complete rewrite in C# for use by .NET applications.\r\n\r\nLatest sample snapshots:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/9hiQn.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/bn2HH.png)\r\n![](http://omeg.pl/blog/wp-content/uploads/gwennet_button.png)\r\n![](http://omeg.pl/blog/wp-content/uploads/gwennet_combo.png)\r\n![](http://omeg.pl/blog/wp-content/uploads/gwennet_text.png)\r\n![](http://omeg.pl/blog/wp-content/uploads/gwennet_splitter.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/lHIUx.png)",
